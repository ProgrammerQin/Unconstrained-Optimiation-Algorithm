# Unconstrained-Optimiation-Algorithm
Using an unconstrained optimization algorithm, determine the minimum of the Rosenbrock’s function: 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦) = 100(𝑦 − 𝑥!)! + (1 − 𝑥)!. For your algorithm, use a convergence tolerance of 1e-5. You should use the following starting points for your algorithm, and determine the optimal point for each starting point: [-1, 1], [0,1] and [2,1]. Display the table containing the following for each iteration
𝑘, (𝑥, 𝑦), 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦), ∇𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦)
where k is the iteration number.
